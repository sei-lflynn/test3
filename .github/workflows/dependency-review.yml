# Dependency Review (PRs and Pushes) — hardened & freshman-friendly
# =============================================================================
# What this workflow does:
#   • On PRs that change dependency manifests: runs GitHub’s Dependency Review,
#     annotates the PR, and (optionally) comments a summary.
#   • On pushes to main (or your chosen branches): compares the new commit to
#     the previous one to catch vulnerable upgrades outside PRs.
#
# Key practices:
#   • Default-deny permissions at workflow level; jobs elevate only what they need.
#   • Pin third-party actions to commit SHAs (reproducible, tamper-resistant).
#   • Guard untrusted PRs (use pull_request, not pull_request_target).
#   • Concurrency cancels superseded runs to avoid CI pile-ups.
#   • Timeouts cap spend and fail fast.
#   • Harden egress (audit → later block + allowlist).
#   • Scoped checkout creds (no pushes from this workflow).
#   • Trigger only when dependency files or this workflow change.
