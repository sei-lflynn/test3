# OSV-Scanner (hardened, pinned, least-privilege)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE
#   Run Google's OSV-Scanner v2 against your repository to detect known
#   vulnerabilities in dependencies, produce a SARIF report, and publish
#   the results to GitHub Code Scanning (Security tab).
#
# DESIGN CHOICES (security & reliability)
#   • Default-deny permissions at the workflow level; jobs elevate only what they need.
#   • SHA-pinned third-party actions for reproducibility and tamper resistance.
#   • Explicit runner version (ubuntu-24.04) for deterministic behavior.
#   • Concurrency cancels superseded runs and prevents CI pile-ups.
#   • Timeouts cap spend and fail fast.
#   • Egress hardening starts in 'audit'; later switch to 'block' with an allowlist.
#   • Two-job split: the scan job is read-only; only the uploader can write security events.
#   • Guarded artifact flow: upload artifact only if a SARIF was generated; uploader runs only then.
#
# OPERATIONAL NOTES
#   • OSV v2 command is `osv-scanner scan ...`.
#   • `--allow-no-lockfiles` avoids failing the run when no manifests are present.
#     Remove it once your repo consistently contains lockfiles/SBOMs.
#   • To gate merges on findings, add `--fail-on=all` (or `--severity=HIGH,CRITICAL`)
#     and remove `continue-on-error: true` in the scan step.
