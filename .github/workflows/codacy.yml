# Codacy Security Scan → Split SARIF runs (hardened, pinned, least-privilege)
# =============================================================================
# What this workflow does (high level):
#   1) Checks out your code with read-only permissions and no persisted creds.
#   2) Runs Codacy Analysis CLI (via pinned action) to generate SARIF results.
#   3) Splits MULTI-run SARIF into SINGLE-run SARIF files (one per analyzer).
#   4) Uploads each SINGLE-run SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning with a unique category.
#   5) Stores the split SARIFs as a build artifact for auditing.
#
# Why we split:
#   • GitHub Code Scanning now requires one SARIF "run" per upload+category.
#     Codacy often outputs multiple runs in a single SARIF (one per tool).
#     Splitting ensures every upload contains exactly one run, avoiding rejections.
#
# Best practices implemented:
#   • Default-deny permissions at the workflow level; jobs elevate only what they need.
#   • Pin third-party actions to commit SHAs (reproducible, tamper resistant).
#   • Guard untrusted PRs (use pull_request, not pull_request_target).
#   • Concurrency cancels superseded runs to prevent CI pile-ups.
#   • Timeouts cap spend and fail fast.
#   • Harden network egress (start in audit; later flip to block + allowlist).
#   • Scoped checkout creds (no pushes from this workflow).
#   • Explicit runner (ubuntu-24.04) for reproducibility.
#   • Results are auditable (artifact with retention).
#
# Tuning notes:
#   • Narrow the 'paths:' filters below to save CI minutes (keep only your languages/manifests).
#   • Decide gating: keep informational (continue-on-error) or fail PRs on findings.
